            <h1> My Git Workflow </h1>
            <p>
                I work in a small team with awesome team-mates. In our team, there are three developers, myself included. To collaborate we use github. When starting to use git, I did face some challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly, I did not fully grasp the concepts and flow of git. Though I still used to make changes, create features and merge my changes with the master branch on the repo, I always had an uncertain and hesistant feeling.I am sort of a visual person and, when it comes to processes, I like to have a clear picture in my head. Hence, I decided to learn more about git.
            </p>
            <p>
                I followed some of the lessons from two of Kevin Skoglund courses on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning"> LinkedIn Learning</a>. I enjoyed watching those lessons and I definitely recommend them to anyone. He clearly described the process and gave clear instructions. The two courses are:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/git-essential-training-the-basics/the-explore-california-website?u=2218586"> Git Essential Training: The Basics </a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/git-branches-merges-and-remotes/delete-a-remote-branch?u=2218586"> Git Branches, Merges, and remotes </a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                After watching these videos, I was able to more clearly visualize what was happening whilst I was pushing to the git remote. Here are commands that I often use to update my latest changes to the master on our github repo.
            </p>
            <h2> Git Clone </h2>
            <p>
                If you want to create a copy of the remote repository, instead of downloading the remote repository, you can simply clone.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Navigate (cd) into a directory that will become the parent directory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go to your github repository. Click on the 'Clone or download' button. There you will see the https web url. Copy it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go back to the terminal and enter the following command:
                        <section class="code"> git clone https_url_of_github_repository<sup>*</sup> </section>
                        <sup>*</sup> This will be the actual https url from your git hub
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2> Status of local repository </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Checking the status of the local repository is a great way to check all the changes that we made into our local branches.
                    <section class="code"> git status </section>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Save changes on local repository </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Add changes:
                    <section class="code"> git add . </section>
                    <div style="text-align: center"> or </div>
                    <section class="code"> git add file_name<sup>*</sup> </section>
                    <sup>*</sup> The name(including the extension) of the file you want to add. If you wish to add more than one file then use a space between the file names to separate them.
                    <br> <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Commit / save the changes:
                    <section class="code"> git commit -m "headline <br>
                        description (optional)" <br>
                    </section>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Compare changes with working directory and origin </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <section class="code">
                        git diff master origin/master
                    </section>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Create new branch in local working directory </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <section class="code">
                        git checkout -b name_of_branch
                    </section>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Delete a branch in local working directory </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <section class="code">
                        git branch -d name_of_branch
                    </section>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> See all branches in the local working directory </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <section class="code">
                        git branch
                    </section>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Go to a specific branch </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <section class="code">
                        git checkout name_of_branch
                    </section>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Push changes to the remote repository on Github </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <section class="code">
                        git push -u origin name_of_branch
                    </section>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> On Remote Repository, merge branch with master </h2>
            <p>
                For the remote repository on Github, when I have to merge a branch that is already on Github, I simply use the Github for merging the branch into master.
            </p>
            <h2> Delete a remote branch from terminal </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <section class="code>">
                        git push origin --delete name_of_branch
                    </section>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Update local branch with Remote Repository on Github </h2>
            <p>
                It is recommended to always update your local repository before you start work or attempt to make any push.
                <br>
                Use either a combination of Git fetch and merge or use git pull. Because I usually like to check the difference in between I usually like to use git fetch and merge.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Git fetch and merge
                    <section class="code">
                        git fetch <br>
