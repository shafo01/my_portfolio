            <p>
                I am new to User Experience Design and sometimes get confused and wonder if I am completing activities in the right manner. I guess this is because UX is sort of like an art and a field that is still in its early days. Maybe only time can help each person decide on what works best for him/her.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my Empathetic Research Framework class assignment I had to create questions for an interview for understanding the experiences, values, beliefs and behaviours of people who recently retired, as it relates to their health and wellness. At first I did not know what kind of questions to ask and how to get them to flow in a conversational manner and at the same time keep to the objectives of the interview. But after contemplating I thought of someone who had recently retired and what questions I could have asked her without making her uncomfortable. I did not realize I was using a persona. I learnt about persona creation before but had considered it as just school work. But upon reflection I was later able to make the connection between in-class personas to real life persons.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love buying gifts for people I care about and I usually put a lot of thoughts into deciding what to buy. But how do I form those thoughts? It is because I know and understand those persons. I guess in UX personas help us build that gap so we can understand the persons we will be interviewing and put thoughts into what to ask them; hence, helping us to further understand them so maybe we can actually be able to improve their experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I know your time is precious so let me get straight to the scenario and discussion guide of this assignment. I skipped the introduction part — self introduction, brief on interview protocol to signing of the consent form.
